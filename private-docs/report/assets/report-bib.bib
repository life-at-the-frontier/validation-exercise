  abstract = {The ethnonational differentiation that characterizes life in Northern Ireland, dating from the seventeenth-century Plantation, is manifest in the high degree of residential segregation and recurrent violence in the Belfast urban area. In turn, this urban encapsulation of the ethnonational conflict exists in microcosm in the Shankill-Falls area of west Belfast. In our examination of how Protestant and Roman Catholic residents in this small area have responded to their environment, we suggest that the idea of the frontier provides a useful explanatory model for understanding the progressive demise of mutal interactions and the increasing hostility between the two groups over the past fifteen years. Each on the periphery of more secure ethnic heartlands, these residents are shown to be the victims of "multiple peripherality" at local, national, and international scales.},

  abstract = {Social frontiers' -- places of sharp difference in social/ethnic characteristics between neighbouring communities -- have largely been overlooked in quantitative research. Advancing this nascent field first requires a way of identifying social frontiers in a robust way. Such frontiers may be `open' -- an area may contrast sharply with a neighbourhood in one direction, but blend smoothly into adjacent neighbourhoods in other directions. This poses some formidable methodological challenges, particularly when computing inference for the existence of a social frontier, an important goal if one is to distinguish true frontiers from random variation. We develop a new approach using Bayesian spatial statistical methods that permit asymmetries in spatial effects and allow for spatial autocorrelation in the data. We illustrate our method using data on Sheffield and find clear evidence of `open' frontiers. Permutations tests and Poisson regressions with fixed effects reveal compelling evidence that social frontiers are associated with higher rates of crime.},

  abstract = {In this chapter, we highlight the importance of social frontiers\textemdash sharp spatial divisions in the residential make-up of adjacent communities\textemdash as a potentially important form of segregation. The handful of studies estimating the impacts of social frontiers have been based in the USA and the UK, both of which are free-market democracies with a long history of immigration, ethnic mix and segregation. There are currently no studies of social frontiers in former socialist countries, for example, or in countries where immigration and ethnic mix are only a recent phenomenon or non-existent. This chapter aims to address this research gap by estimating the impacts of social frontiers on crime rates in a post-socialist country, Czechia. We demonstrate how a Bayesian spatial conditional autoregressive estimation can be used to detect social frontiers in this setting, and we use a fixed effect quasi-Poisson model to investigate the impact on crime. Our results suggest that in new immigration destinations, social frontiers may not be associated with higher rates of crime, at least in the short run. Moreover, our use of cultural distance measures helps to promote a more nuanced approach to studying the impact of segregation and highlights the role of cultural diversity in understanding the link between immigrant segregation and crime. We reflect on how this approach could contribute to the study of segregation and inequality in the Chinese context.},

The research draws on stories, maps and focus group interviews with 80 children aged between 14 \textendash{} 15 years of age, living in one of the most contested interface areas in Northern Ireland. Interface areas are locations where Catholics and Protestants live side by side in segregated communities divided by peace walls and other symbolic boundaries. Within these spaces, children made distinctions between place and territory. Place was referred to in relation to physical features of the surrounding landscape but more importantly as spaces where family and friendship ties were paramount. Territory on the other hand was referred to in terms of Protestant and Catholic identity.},

  abstract = {Background Neighbourhood segregation has been described as a fundamental determinant of physical health, but literature on its effect on mental health is less clear. While most previous research has relied on conceptualised measures of segregation, Northern Ireland is unique as it contains physical manifestations of segregation in the form of segregation barriers (or `peacelines') which can be used to accurately identify residential segregation. Methods We used population-wide health record data on over 1.3 million individuals, to analyse the effect of residential segregation, measured by both the formal Dissimilarity Index and by proximity to a segregation barrier, on the likelihood of poor mental health. Results Using multilevel logistic regression models, we found residential segregation measured by the Dissimilarity Index poses no additional risk to the likelihood of poor mental health after adjustment for area-level deprivation. However, residence in an area segregated by a `peaceline' increases the likelihood of antidepressant medication by 19\% (OR=1.19, 95\% CI 1.14 to 1.23) and anxiolytic medication by 39\% (OR=1.39, 95\% CI 1.32 to 1.48), even after adjustment for gender, age, conurbation, deprivation and crime. Conclusions Living in an area segregated by a `peaceline' is detrimental to mental health suggesting segregated areas characterised by a heightened sense of `other' pose a greater risk to mental health. The difference in results based on segregation measure highlights the importance of choice of measure when studying segregation.},
