## Summaries and questions 

**Why do boundaries matter?**

In Legewie's framework people are i) threatened by out groups and ii) seek to defend neighbourhoods of their community. Social boundaries are socially constructed symbolic boundaries -- which may coincide with other boundaries. 

Socially constructed implicityly assumes that these relations exist in actors. Seeking to defend neighbourhoods 


Key questions: 
- what are the definitions of border / social frontiers / research question
- what's the theory of change (i.e. why do boundaries matter)
- what empirical method was used 
	- was there any validation
- what are the uses

Hypothesis:

> This article proposes the __contested boundaries hypothesis__ as a refined contextual explanation focused on poorly defined boundaries between ethnic and racial groups. The authors argue that neighborhood conflict is more likely to occur at fuzzy boundaries defined as interstitial or transitional areas sandwiched between two homogeneous communities.

> We argue that neighborhood conflict arises at poorly defined boundaries that separate ethnic and racial groups. Such fuzzy boundaries are interstitial or transitional areas sandwiched between two homogeneous communities. They are contested because they threaten homogeneous community life and foster ambiguities about group rank. Above and beyond disorganization and diverging ways of life generally found in mixed neighborhoods, their location between differently populated homogeneous communities triggers hostility. Well-defined boundaries, by contrast, are accepted divisions between one group’sturfandanother’s and are thus less contested. By focusing on the broader sociospatial structure, the contested boundaries hypothesis overcomes the “aspatial” treatment of neighborhoods as isolated areas in research on ethnic diversity. It highlights how residential segregation creates contentious areas at the places where groups border.


Definition of boundaries and frontiers:

key concept = __edge intensity__ 

> Edge intensity is a sociospatial feature that captures changes in the composition of neighborhoods across space. It ranges from no change in racial composition (no boundary, e.g., within a homogeneous or diverse area), to gradual changes in interstitial or transitional areas (fuzzy boundaries of different strengths), and finally to abrupt transitions from one group’s turf to another’s(well-defined or clear-cut boundaries).


Examples of boundaries:

- Research on gang violence highlights that shared turf boundaries (Papachristos, Hureau, and Braga 2013) or boundary crossings (Radil, Flint, and Tita 2010) are an important predictor of violence. 
- -Desmond and Valdez (2013) claim that neighborhoods at the edges of segregated black communities have particularly high frequencies of nuisance property citations because nonblack residents feel threatened by their black neighbors. 

**theory of change**

Essentialy trying to explain why conflicts may occur at fuzzy boundaries 

> As reviewed above, a common argument in the literature is that ethnoracial compositions have the potential to stir social tensions because out-group members are perceived as threatening.

^ my note: this is merely the presence of outgroups in areas 

From here it seems that it's given that resident can 'feel' which areas are part of their community:

> Gould (2003) and others claim that polarized situations in which two equally sized opponents face each other are even more contentious than circumstances in which a majority defends its space against the in-migration of minorities. Here the ambiguity about social rank—that is, who is the dominating group—breeds conflict.

Second reason is *defended neighbourhoods*:

> The defended neighborhoods literature further suggests that residents of ethnically homogeneous areas develop exclusive community identities. Campbell et al. (2009) note how ethnoracial compositions inform people’s subjective construction of neighborhood boundaries correspondingly. Minorities’ in-migration to homogeneous areas contests these subjective boundaries and is consequently met by strong resistance to defend the integrity of the dominant group’s neighborhood community.

note: The defended neighbourhood hypothesis depends on the existence of recognisible neighbourhoods and boundaries 

my note: the concept of turf etc is used throughout

**Method**

Basically proposal to do edge detection:
> The term edge detection refers to a number of mathematical methods with the goal to detect “points in a digital image at which the image brightness changes sharply or, more formally, has discontinuities” (Nosrati et al. 2013, p. 116; see also Ziou and Tabbone 1998; Shapiro and Stockman 2001). These algorithms are a fundamental and well-established tool in image processing and computer vision with applications ranging from image sharpening, over robotics, to driverless cars (Shapiro and Stockman 2001). Edge detection algorithms are part of a larger literature on spatial boundary detection. This literature includes various methods used in ecology, epidemiology, and other areas, such as “wombling” (Jacquez, Maruca, and Fortin 2000; Dale and Fortin 2014), or methods based on ecocentric signatures and cluster analysis (Logan et al. 2011; Spielman and Logan 2013). Most of the existing boundary analysis methods are designed for either point-specific data with known coordinates or regular lattices such as images (Nosrati et al. 2013; Dale and Fortin 2014).4 Directly applying these methods to the ethnoracial composition of neighborhoods would require a high-resolution spatial grid with point-specific information about ethnoracial composition. The smallest available census aggregation, however, is the census block level.

Abstract: 
Neighborhood boundaries are a defining aspect of highly segregated urban areas. Yet, few studies examine the particular challenges and spatial processes that occur at the bordering region between two neighborhoods. Extending the growing literature on spatial interdependence, this article argues that neighborhood boundaries—defined as sharp changes in the racial or socioeconomic composition of neighborhoods—are a salient feature of the spatial structure with implications for violent crime and other outcomes. Boundaries lack the social control and cohesion of adjacent homogeneous areas, are contested between groups provoking intergroup conflict, and create opportunities for criminal behavior. This article presents evidence linking racial neighborhood boundaries to increased violent crime. The findings illustrate the importance of neighborhood boundaries for our understanding of spatial dimensions of population dynamics above and beyond the characteristics of neighborhoods.


**What is a boundary?**

Examplies directly from start of paper:

> In 1945, St. Clair Drake and Horace R. Cayton argued in “Black Metropolis” (1945/1993:190) that “one consequence of the pattern of residential segregation is that an area of potential conflict has been created all around the boundaries of the Black Belt.” More recently, Elijah Anderson (1990:154–156) reported about “the edge” in Eastern City (a pseudonym for his case study city) as “the place where two communities meet, where the lower-income black residents come in contact with the middle- and upper-income white ones.” Pattillo (2007) described what residents call the “dividing” or “invisible” line in Chicago’s South Side as an area that separates prospering South from languishing North Kenwood.

Whilst not directly commenting on whether people can sense boundaries, I think it remains an implicity assumption:

> Like “the edge” in Eastern City and the “dividing line” in Chicago’s South Side, social boundaries capture the transition from a low-class to a high-class neighborhood or from a predominantly white to a Hispanic area. They are related to symbolic neighborhood boundaries defined as conceptual categorizations of space into distinct areas and to political boundaries defined as administrative borders that divide geographical areas into school districts, police precincts, congressional districts, or others. In contrast to physical boundaries, such as railways, major roads, or rivers, social neighborhood boundaries facilitate contact and potentially conflict between distinct groups.


Legewie wants to look at symbolic  boundaries:

> Symbolic (neighborhood) boundaries, in contrast, refer to the subjective separation of space into distinct areas. Following the broader boundary concept, symbolic boundaries are conceived as “conceptual distinctions made by social actors to categorize objects, people, practices, and even time and space” that “separate people into groups and generate feelings of similarity and group membership” (Lamont and Molnar 2002:168).

- on p. 1959 these areas are described as socially constructed 

my note is obviously whether we can detect symbolic / socially constructued boundaries using currently available datasets and methods. 

**Methods**


Good literature on other uses
> Researchers from various disciplines have developed methods to detect neighborhood boundaries (Dale and Fortin 2014; Jacquez et al. 2000;Logan et al. 2011; Spielman and Logan 2013). These methods are often called “wombling” based on foundational work by Womble (1951). In ecology, they are used to identify boundaries (also called “ecotones”) in species or habitat distributions, to study environmental factors associated with these boundaries, and to examine the effect of boundaries (Fagan et al. 2003). In computer vision, image processing, and machine learning, edge-detection algorithms are essential tools with applications ranging from image sharpening to robotics and driverless cars (Shapiro and Stockman 2001). A separate literature has focused on identifying neighborhoods and their boundaries based on complete-count microdata from historical censuses (Logan et al. 2011;Spielmanand Logan 2013).

This article uses areal wombling 

> This article uses areal wombling as a boundary detection approach designed for areal data (Liang et al. 2009;LuandCarlin2005;Luetal.2007). It is based on the idea that two adjacent areas are separated by a boundary if the difference between the two areas in some response variable exceeds a threshold.

^ the above areal wombling technique uses
- pairs of adjcent areas (based on distance or whatever) 
- calculating the difference in attributes between pairs (called *boundary value* or in our paper sharpness )
- the attribute is the proportion of several ethinic minority
	- i.e. combines boundary values using white, afriance etc 
	- takes the max of difference across groups (i.e. if max is African then they use the Boundary value for african)
	- suppupplemntary uses other pairwse values 
^ my note: therefore actually our validiation exercise is valid
